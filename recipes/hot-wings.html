            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <em>For the rub</em>
            <ol>
                <li>combine the above mentioned rub ingredients into a large mixing bowl or one gallon zip-lock bag</li>
                <li>Whisk, shake, or stir untill the rub is throughly blended and homogenous</li>
                <li>set rub aside</li>
              
               </ol>
        <em>For the wings</em>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> For this method we are going to use an air fryer. Any brand or size will do</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat air fryer to 375 degrees Farenheight</li>
                    <li>Using our already seperated wings, place them on a plate or wire rack and dry them throurougly with a paper towel. this will help our rub bind better the the skin of the chicken and allow for maximum coverage. Make sure to set aside this plate/rack once done as it will now be contaminated</li>
                    <li>with the wings dried, toss them thouroughly with the rub we prepared from above. Make sure to get an evenly distributed coat along all sides of the wings for maximum</li>
                    <li>with the air fryer pre heated and our wings coated, distribute them evenly in the airfryer to allow for optimal circulation and set the timer for 10 minutes</li>
                    <li>After 10 minutes, carefully flip the wings and cook them for another 8 minutes</li>
                    <li>once complete, confirm that the internal temp of the wings reached 165 degrees farenheight and place them on a wire raack to rest for 5 minutes</li>
                    <li>After 5 minutes, put the wings in a bowl and toss them in your favorite sauce, we reccomend the "Pepper X" collaboration between the creator and the Hot Ones youtube series</li>
                    <li>Enjoy!</li>
                </ol>
