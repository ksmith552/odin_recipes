    <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
        <p>In this day in age, getting a quality pie is an endless gauntlent in and of itself. Every big chain and even now the local joints, continue to put out sub par product in exchange for higher profit margins and units sold. In addition to this, most franchises and employers will run with skeleton crews to keep labor down and profits up. The end result? A continuous degredation of quality that we, the consumer, have to tolerate untill we finally break down and inevitably say, "Even I can cook a better pizza than this!"</p>

        <p>With this recipe, we're going to do exactly that! We will procure the finest and highest quality ingredients at our disposal to create an end product that you have likely never witnessed before(outside of Buca De Beppo, of course). If you are unable to procure any of these exact ingredients, thats okay! Substitute any brand of the ingredients you see here and I gurantee even if you buy the lowest quality of ingredients, the end product you consume will be one ofthe best pizza's you have ever had!</p>

        <h2>Method</h2>
        Making the pizza dough
            <ol>
                <li>Proof the yeast:</li>
                    <p>Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.</p>

                    <p>After 5 minutes stir if the yeast hasn't dissolved completely. The yeast should begin to foam or bloom, indicating that the yeast is still active and alive.</p>

                    <p>(Note that if you are using "instant yeast" instead of "active yeast", no proofing is required. Just add to the flour in the next step.)</p>

                <li>Make and knead the pizza dough:</li>
                    <p>Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed for a minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.</p>

                    <p>Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes.</p>

                    <p>If you don't have a mixer, you can mix the ingredients together and knead them by hand.</p>

                    <p>The dough should be a little sticky, or tacky to the touch. If it's too wet, sprinkle in a little more flour.</p>
